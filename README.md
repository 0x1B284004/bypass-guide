# Bypass Guide

guide to use codecore 2pc/1pc bypass ! 

# Way of uses :

You can use the bypass in 2 ways, one being more powerful and one being quicker,
They both requires restarting the game each match, but one allows you to use 1pc
While the other requires a FULLY UNBANNED PC.

# 1 PC : 

Make sure that you are NOT banned, not delay banned, if so, you will have to use the 2PC method.
Step 1 : Launch Valorant.
Step 2 : Find a match, pick your agent.
Step 3 : Once you are in the loading screen showing the server, game-mode, map etc..., Close the game using the task manager.
Step 4 : Now, Launch the bypass and select the first option, wait for it to do its things and then open the game.
Step 5 : You do not have to kill VGC in the task-manager. You can know inject your cheats and have fun until the end of the match, 
         where you'll have to close the game, the cheat, restart your pc (to clean traces of cheats injections.), and then re-do the whole process.

# 2 PC : 

You can use this method even if you are banned, getting delays-bans, VAL 152.
You need a fully unbanned PC (doesnt require to be powerful, its just to launch the match and pick your agent) that we will call here PC A
We will call your main computer PC B, it can be banned, you can have TPM OFF etc...

Step 1 : PC A : Launch Valorant.
Step 2 : PC A : Find a match, pick your agent.
Step 3 : PC A : Once you are in the loading screen showing the server, game-mode, map etc..., Close the game using the task manager.
Step 4 : PC A : Startup menu -> Stop.
Step 5 : PC B : Launch the bypass and select the first option, wait for it to do its things and then open the game.
Step 6 : PC B : You do not have to kill VGC in the task-manager. You can know inject your cheats and have fun until the end of the match,
                where you'll have to close the game, the cheat and the bypass on PC B and start everything back from Step 1 : PC A.
